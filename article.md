## The application architecture

Starting a Google Chrome app requires only one file in addition to the normal web application file. The manifest file contains all of the information Chrome needs to launch your application. The [manifest file][manifest] is written in the JSON format so should be familiar to most JavaScript developers.

* Manifest
* backbone
* Settings
* i18n
* etc.

## Considerations

* No access to remote images
* Background processing
* Testing

## Processing the news feeds

* Stumbling blocks
* How it was done

## Displaying the articles

## Filtering categories

* Using the displayed articles collection
* Re-rendering the view

## i18n

## Dealing with settings

* Changing the name of the country on language change
* Setting default categories
